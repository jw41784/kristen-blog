          I help organizations figure out why their "amazing culture" somehow feels terrible 
          to work in. Plot twist: it's usually not the free snacks.

      <h2>What I actually do</h2>
      
      <p>
        I have a PhD in I/O Psychology (yes, that's a real thing), and I spend my days 
        translating between executives who think ping pong tables = culture and employees 
        who just want to do good work without losing their minds.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What I'm really good at:</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employee Listening:</strong> Building systems that actually capture what people think (not just what they're willing to say in a survey)</li>
        <li><strong>Culture Reality Checks:</strong> Telling you why your culture initiative isn't working (and what might actually help)</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership Translation:</strong> Helping executives understand why their team keeps saying "fine" when asked how things are going</li>
        <li><strong>BS Detection:</strong> Spotting the gap between what organizations say they value and what they actually reward</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>My vibe</h2>
      
      <p>
        I believe in being direct (but not mean), practical (but not boring), and honest about 
        the fact that most workplace problems are hilariously predictable once you know what to look for.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This blog is where I share the patterns I see, the mistakes that keep happening, and 
        occasionally celebrate the organizations that actually get it right. Think of it as workplace 
        therapy, but with more data and fewer trust falls.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>
      
      <p>
        After a decade of watching the same workplace disasters play out on repeat, I figured 
        it was time to start talking about them publicly. Maybe if we all acknowledge that 
        most employee engagement surveys are basically organizational horoscopes, we can start 
        building something better.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether you're a leader who suspects your culture might be broken, an HR person tired 
        of explaining why your latest initiative didn't work, or just someone who thinks work 
        shouldn't feel like existential dread with benefitsâ€”this is for you.
