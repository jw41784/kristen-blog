      <h2>My Expertise</h2>
      
      <p>
        With a PhD in I/O Psychology, I specialize in employee listening and culture transformation. 
        My work focuses on bridging the gap between what organizations think they know about their 
        employees and what's actually happening on the ground.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Core Areas of Focus</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employee Listening:</strong> Designing and implementing systems that capture authentic employee voices</li>
        <li><strong>Culture Transformation:</strong> Guiding organizations through meaningful cultural shifts</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Helping senior leaders understand and respond to organizational dynamics</li>
        <li><strong>Organizational Assessment:</strong> Using data-driven approaches to diagnose and solve workplace challenges</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      
      <p>
        I believe in transparency, practicality, and a touch of humor when tackling serious organizational 
        challenges. My writing reflects this philosophyâ€”I aim to make complex psychological concepts 
        accessible and actionable for leaders at all levels.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Through this blog, I share insights from my consulting work, observations about workplace 
        trends, and practical advice for creating organizations where both people and performance flourish.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
      
      <p>
        After years of advising senior leaders behind closed doors, I wanted to create a space where 
        I could share broader insights about the patterns I see across organizations. This blog is 
        my way of contributing to important conversations about the future of work, leadership, and 
        organizational psychology.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether you're a CEO trying to understand your culture, an HR leader implementing change, 
        or someone passionate about workplace psychology, I hope you'll find value in these reflections.
