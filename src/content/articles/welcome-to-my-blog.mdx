After years of working behind the scenes with senior leaders, I've decided it's time to share some of the patterns, insights, and occasional absurdities I've observed in the world of workplace psychology.

## Why This Blog?

Let me be transparent (a theme you'll see throughout my writing): I've been hesitant to start a blog. Not because I lack opinions—ask anyone who's sat through one of my presentations—but because the internet already has plenty of voices telling leaders what to do.

What finally pushed me over the edge? Three things:

1. **The disconnect is real.** The gap between what executives think is happening in their organizations and what employees actually experience has never been wider.

2. **Good intentions aren't enough.** I've watched too many well-meaning culture initiatives fail because they ignored basic psychological principles.

3. **We need more honest conversations.** The business world loves its buzzwords and quick fixes. I'm more interested in what actually works.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will focus on the intersection of psychology, business, and the messy reality of organizational life. Topics will include:

- **Employee Listening:** Going beyond annual surveys to understand what your people really think
- **Culture Transformation:** Why most efforts fail and what actually moves the needle
- **Leadership Psychology:** The mental models that help (and hinder) executive decision-making
- **Data & Intuition:** How to balance metrics with human insight

## My Approach

I believe in being practical without being simplistic. Organizations are complex systems made up of complex humans. There are rarely easy answers, but there are better questions we can ask.

I'll share real examples (anonymized, of course) from my consulting work. I'll challenge conventional wisdom when it deserves challenging. And yes, I'll occasionally poke fun at corporate jargon because someone needs to.

## Who This Is For

If you're a leader trying to build a better workplace, an HR professional navigating organizational dynamics, or simply someone interested in the psychology of work, you'll find value here.

Fair warning: I won't promise you "5 Easy Steps to Transform Your Culture" or "The One Weird Trick to Engage Employees." Real change is harder than that, but it's also more rewarding.

## Let's Connect

I'm looking forward to building a community of thoughtful practitioners who care about making work better for everyone. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, where I'll share new posts and continue these conversations.

Welcome to the journey. It's going to be interesting.
